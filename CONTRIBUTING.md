## Coding Standards

* Follow [Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
* Use meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes
* Keep methods small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Add XML documentation for public APIs
* Use async/await appropriately for I/O operations

### Code Style
```csharp
// ✅ Good: Clear naming and structure
public class PaymentServiceImpl : IPaymentService
{
    private readonly ILogger<PaymentServiceImpl> _logger;
    private readonly IMetricsCollector _metrics;

    /// <summary>
    /// Processes a payment request asynchronously
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="request">The payment request details</param>
    /// <returns>Payment processing result</returns>
    public async Task<ProcessPaymentResponse> ProcessPaymentAsync(ProcessPaymentRequest request)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Processing payment for order {OrderId}", request.OrderId);
        
        try
        {
            var result = await ProcessPaymentInternalAsync(request);
            _metrics.IncrementCounter("payments_processed", 1);
            return result;
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to process payment for order {OrderId}", request.OrderId);
            _metrics.IncrementCounter("payment_errors", 1);
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

### Framework Integration
- Always inject framework services through DI
- Use the provided abstractions (`IMetricsCollector`, `IDistributedTracing`, etc.)
- Follow the established patterns in existing services

### Configuration
- Use the `ResilientMicroservices` configuration section
- Provide sensible defaults
- Support environment variable overrides

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
```bash
tests/
├── ResilientMicroservices.Core.Tests/          # Unit tests for Core
├── PaymentService.Tests/                       # Unit tests for PaymentService
├── InventoryService.Tests/                     # Unit tests for InventoryService
├── ResilientMicroservices.Metrics.Tests/       # Unit tests for Metrics
└── Integration.Tests/                          # Integration tests
```

### Writing Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user scenarios

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task ProcessPaymentAsync_ValidRequest_ShouldReturnSuccessResponse()
{
    // Arrange
    var request = new ProcessPaymentRequest
    {
        OrderId = 123,
        Amount = 99.99m,
        PaymentMethod = "credit_card"
    };

    // Act
    var result = await _paymentService.ProcessPaymentAsync(request);

    // Assert
    result.Should().NotBeNull();
    result.Status.Should().BeOneOf(PaymentStatus.Completed, PaymentStatus.Failed);
    
    _mockMetrics.Verify(m => m.IncrementCounter("payments_processed", 1), Times.Once);
}
```

* All new code must have tests
* Maintain or improve code coverage
* Tests must be reliable and deterministic
* Use descriptive test names
* Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test project
dotnet test tests/PaymentService.Tests/

# Run tests with filter
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"
```

## Documentation

### What to Document
- **Public APIs**: XML documentation for all public methods
- **Configuration**: Document all configuration options
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples
- **Architecture**: Update diagrams when making structural changes

### Documentation Formats
- **Code Comments**: XML documentation for APIs
- **Markdown**: For guides and documentation files
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: For architecture and flow diagrams
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Auto-generated for REST APIs

### Writing Guidelines
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Consider both beginners and experienced developers

## Architecture Guidelines

### Adding New Framework Components
1. **Core Abstractions**: Define interfaces in `ResilientMicroservices.Core`
2. **Implementation**: Create concrete implementation in appropriate library
3. **Registration**: Add DI registration in `ServiceCollectionExtensions`
4. **Configuration**: Support configuration through `appsettings.json`
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
6. **Documentation**: Update architecture docs and examples

### Integration Patterns
- Use dependency injection for all framework components
- Follow the repository pattern for data access
- Implement health checks for external dependencies
- Record metrics for monitoring and observability
- Support distributed tracing for request correlation

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start your day
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and test
dotnet build
dotnet test

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Before Submitting PR
```bash
# Ensure you're up to date
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Run full test suite
dotnet test

# Check code formatting
dotnet format --verify-no-changes

# Build in release mode
dotnet build --configuration Release
```
